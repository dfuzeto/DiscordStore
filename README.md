## Rox Sell System

#(THIS IS DEMO VERSION

This project integrates a Discord bot, developed using Axios and Discord.js, with the Mercado Pago API to facilitate the sale of game keys. The application automates the purchasing process, allowing users to acquire game keys directly on Discord, with payment integration through Mercado Pago.

The solution includes a website that serves as an interface to control the inventory of game keys, allowing for the management of sales, inventory updates, and transaction tracking in real-time.

The Node.js API centralizes all operations, ensuring seamless communication between the Discord bot, the website, and the payment system efficiently and securely. The backend is responsible for managing the data flow, updating stock, and processing payments transparently.

## Key Features

- **Discord Bot**: Sell game keys directly on the Discord platform.
- **Mercado Pago Integration**: Secure payment processing.
- **Real-time Inventory Control**: Manage and update inventory through an administrative website.
- **Node.js API**: Centralized management of system operations, ensuring seamless communication between the components.

## How It Works

### 1. **Discord Bot**  
The bot is responsible for selling game keys directly within Discord. Users can interact with the bot to view available keys and purchase them through a simple interface.

### 2. **Mercado Pago Integration**  
Mercado Pago is integrated into the system to handle payment processing securely. Once a user chooses a game key to purchase, the bot redirects them to the Mercado Pago checkout for payment.

### 3. **Real-Time Inventory Control**  
The administrative website allows the inventory of game keys to be tracked and managed in real-time. The inventory is updated as sales are made, ensuring that stock levels are always accurate.

### 4. **Node.js API**  
The backend API, built with Node.js, serves as the communication hub for all components. It handles user requests from the Discord bot, interacts with Mercado Pago for payment processing, and updates the inventory via the administrative website.
